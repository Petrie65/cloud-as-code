# Cloud as Code

## Provision with Terraform

Using terraform we are able to make a immutable infrastructure which can be destroyed and created using single command.

Commands used:

`terraform init` : Initialize a Terraform working directory

`terraform plan` : Generate and show an execution plan

`terraform apply` : Builds or changes infrastructure

`terraform destroy` : Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure

## Configure with Ansible

`ansible-playbook playbook.yml`
